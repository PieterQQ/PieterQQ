## About me

Studying programming for few years already. Started with C++ and simple console profects. Then i decided to continue studying on WyÅ¼sza SzkoÅ‚a Bankowa where i got diploma for Programming and also graphic design.  At university i discovered C# and gained some skills in solo and group programming projects. Now it's my hobby, when i have some freetime i look for new inspiration and start programming. By far im Backend dev, but i want to learn some Frontend solution and become Fullstack Dev
